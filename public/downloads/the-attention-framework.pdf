# The Attention Framework

## A Practical System for Earning Distribution

---

### The Core Principle

Attention is not awarded for quality.

It is allocated for **predictable engagement**.

Platforms ask one question:

“If we show this to more people, will it keep them here longer?”

---

## The Four Components of Attention

### 1. Trigger

The first seconds decide everything.

Your content must immediately signal:
- relevance
- clarity
- low effort to consume

No trigger → no test distribution.

---

### 2. Retention

Platforms measure:
- watch time
- scroll depth
- completion

Clarity beats cleverness.

---

### 3. Feedback

Not all engagement is equal.

Saves and rewatches signal future value.

They matter more than likes.

---

### 4. Expansion

Distribution widens only after strong early signals.

Most content never reaches this stage.

---

## Why Effort Doesn’t Matter

Effort is invisible to algorithms.

Only behavior exists.

---

## How To Use This Framework

Before publishing, ask:

1. Is the trigger obvious?
2. Is comprehension effortless?
3. Is there a reason to return?
4. Does it match platform incentives?

If not → redesign.

## Final Note

Growth is not about posting more.

It is about designing content systems want to amplify.
