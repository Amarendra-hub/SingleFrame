# How Attention Is Actually Distributed

The most common belief about attention is also the most misleading:

> “Good content eventually wins.”

It doesn’t.

Attention is distributed according to **system incentives**, not merit.

## Platforms Are Not Neutral

Every platform has one primary goal:
maximize time spent.

Everything else is secondary.

This means content is evaluated by:
- how predictable its performance is
- how reliably it keeps users engaged
- how easily it can be reused as a pattern

Truth, nuance, and originality are optional.

## Early Distribution Is a Test

When you publish, your content is shown to a **small test group**.

The system watches:
- how fast people stop scrolling
- how long they stay
- whether they interact

Most content fails here.

Not because it’s bad —  
but because it is **unclear or demanding**.

## Why Familiarity Wins

Familiar formats reduce risk.

They:
- require less cognitive effort
- have known engagement curves
- are easier for algorithms to predict

This is why repetition outperforms novelty.

---

## Quality Still Matters — Just Not First

Quality affects:
- retention
- long-term trust
- reputation

But it does **not** trigger distribution.

Distribution comes first.  
Quality determines whether it lasts.

---

## The Real Shift

Stop asking:
> “Is this good?”

Start asking:
> “Is this legible to the system?”

That shift alone changes outcomes.
