# The Attention Framework

Attention is not random.

It follows incentives.

Most creators optimize for effort. Platforms optimize for behavior.

## The Three Layers

### Trigger
Content must be legible enough to test.

### Retention
The system measures how long users stay.

### Propagation
Only after retention does sharing matter.

Effort is invisible. Behavior is measurable.
