# The Attention Framework

Attention is not random.

It is not a reward for effort, consistency, or even quality.  
It is a consequence of **system incentives**.

The Attention Framework is a way to reason about why some content spreads
predictably while most content disappears immediately.

---

## The Core Insight

Attention flows toward **signals platforms can measure and reuse**.

Not truth.  
Not originality.  
Not depth.

Platforms optimize for signals that:
- keep users engaged
- reduce uncertainty
- can be scaled across millions of pieces of content

If your work does not emit those signals, it will not be distributed.

---

## The Three Layers of Attention

### 1. Trigger
Something must cause the system to test your content.

Examples:
- curiosity gaps
- clear tension
- relevance to an active audience cluster

No trigger → no test.

---

### 2. Retention
Once tested, the system measures whether users stay.

This includes:
- time spent
- scroll depth
- replays
- pauses

If users leave early, distribution collapses.

---

### 3. Propagation
Only after retention does sharing matter.

This includes:
- saves
- reshares
- downstream engagement

Propagation is a **result**, not a cause.

---

## Why Most Content Fails

Most creators optimize for:
- how much effort they put in
- how long they worked
- how “good” it feels

Platforms do not measure effort.  
They measure **behavioral response**.

The mismatch is why frustration is common.

## How to Use This Framework

Before publishing, ask:
- What triggers the first test?
- Where is retention most likely to break?
- What action signals value to the system?

This reframes content from expression to **design**.

**Note:**  
An expanded, paid edition of *The Attention Framework* is in progress.  
It will include templates, deeper breakdowns, and real-world examples.
