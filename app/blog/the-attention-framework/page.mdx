# The Attention Framework

Most creators think growth is random.

It isn’t.

Platforms follow consistent rules.  
This framework explains those rules in a usable way.

---

## The Core Principle

Attention is not given for quality.

It is allocated for **predictable engagement**.

Every platform asks one question:

> “If we show this to more people, will it keep them here longer?”

Everything else is secondary.

---

## The 4 Components of Attention

### 1. Trigger

The first 1–2 seconds decide everything.

Your content must immediately signal:
- relevance
- clarity
- low effort to consume

No curiosity → no test distribution.

---

### 2. Retention

Platforms measure:
- watch time
- scroll depth
- completion

If users hesitate or pause too long, reach decays.

Clarity beats cleverness.

---

### 3. Feedback

Likes, comments, saves, shares.

Not equally weighted.

**Saves and rewatches** matter more than likes.

They signal future value.

---

### 4. Expansion

Only after strong early signals does distribution widen.

This is where most creators fail:
they never pass the first test.

---

## Why Effort Doesn’t Matter

Effort is invisible to algorithms.

Only **behavioral signals** exist.

A 5-minute clear explanation beats a 2-hour masterpiece.

---

## How To Use This Framework

Before publishing anything, ask:

1. Is the trigger obvious in 2 seconds?
2. Is comprehension effortless?
3. Is there a reason to save or return?
4. Does it match platform incentives?

If the answer is “no” to any → redesign.

---

## Final Note

Growth is not about posting more.

It is about designing content that systems want to amplify.

This framework is the foundation.

**Note:**  
An expanded, paid edition of *The Attention Framework* is in progress.  
It will include practical templates, deeper breakdowns, and real examples.
