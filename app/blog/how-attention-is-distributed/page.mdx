# How Attention Is Actually Distributed

Most advice about growth focuses on tactics.  
Platforms focus on **incentives**.

This mismatch is why most creators fail.

## The Core Mechanism

Every platform optimizes for one thing:

> **Sustained user engagement at scale**

Not quality.  
Not fairness.  
Not creator success.

Visibility is allocated based on signals that predict this outcome.

## Why Most Content Never Breaks Out

Three reasons:

1. Engagement signals are weak
2. Distribution is front-loaded
3. Feedback loops are asymmetric

If early signals are below threshold, reach collapses.

## The Practical Implication

Growth is not about “more content”.

It is about:
- Designing stronger early signals
- Reducing cognitive load
- Matching platform incentives

This is a systems problem, not a motivation problem.
