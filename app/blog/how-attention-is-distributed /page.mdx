# How Attention Is Actually Distributed

Quality does not trigger distribution.

Predictability does.

Platforms test content in small batches.

If early signals are weak, reach collapses.

## Why Familiarity Wins

Familiar formats reduce cognitive load.

Reduced friction increases engagement probability.

Distribution is a probability engine — not a merit system.
